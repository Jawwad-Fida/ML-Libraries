1. Understand the math behind algorithms
2. How these algorithms behave w.r.t. numerical  and categorical variables ?
    a. Decision Tree uses different ways to split numerical and categorical predictors/variables.
3. How these algorithms works with Text Data ?
     a. Stemming and  Lemmatization
     b. Bag of words
     c. TF-DIF
     d. Word2Vec
4. For which scenario these algorithms are used? 
     a. Regression - Linear regression
     b. Classification - Logistic regression , Naive Bayes Classifier
     c. Both - Decision Tree
5. Over-fitting and Under-fitting Conditions :-
     a. Hyper parameter tuning
     b. Decision Tree Pruning 
6. Impact of Algorithm w.r.t Imbalanced Datasets and how do you fix that?
    a. Binary Classification Problem
    b. Feature Scaling
          # Up-sampling
          # Down-sampling
7. Impact of Outliers, How to treat them?
8. For which Algorithm, feature Scaling/Normalization is required w.r.t Datasets:-
    a. DT, Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, ADABoost - Not required
    b. Linear Regression, Logistic Regression - Required.
