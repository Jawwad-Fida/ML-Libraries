and here you'll be introduced with a new programming language which is octave.
Octave is very clear cut and fun language.

you can use that but recommended python as you'll need it.

Andrew Sir will use octave language for the implementation of the algorithms, but you can use python as well.
just you need to learn numpy, matplotlib and sklearn for loading dataset only

don't use sklearn built algorithm as a beginner
it'll be harmful
