
Databases vs Spreadsheets (Excel)

Spreadsheets -> electronic ledger to store data in tabular form (like an electronic 
version of paper)

Both: - can contain large amounts of tabular data, can use existing data to make 
calculations, are used by many users

But: - Database contains only raw data --> shows error in case of data misplacement
      (cant store diff kinds of data in the same column) but now shown in a spreadsheet
       
data is stored in a record of table in dbms, but in spreadsheets data is stored in a cell.
no formatting in dbms

in spreadsheets, diff cells can contain calculations (functions and formulas)
in dbms, all calculations and operations are done after data retrieval

why database is preferred?
excel - 1 million rows max, every person must update their own spreadsheet
dbms - more than 1 millions row, one person can make a change which is visible to everyday
also eliminates duplicate information - UNIQUE
